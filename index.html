    <h1>To be honest:</h1>
    I was sick of reworking my website every two years just to try out 
    the newest design and tech hypes.<br />
    So I decided to try out a new approach. 
    I will build a <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital garden</a> 
    here that will evolve and transform over the time.<br /> No fancy stuff any more just to impress.
    No new technology just for the flex. <br />
    I am in this game for over 11 years. It doesn"t proove that I am able to write any language or framework.<br />
    It prooves that I am able to adopt. Thats it what counts.<br />
    In the future here will be just stuff that I care about.
